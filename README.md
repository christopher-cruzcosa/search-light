## Description 
A CLI application using a mySQL database for reviewing, adding, and modifying employee records in the le Phare Corporation.
         
## Installation
This application uses the Inquirer, mySQL, and Console.Table modules. The primary mySQL files are a database with three tables, for employees and departments and role.  The application is controlled via a single index.js file.  
          
## Usage 
The user can view all employees, and drill down to see employees by department or manager.  The user also has the ability to add a new employee and then either modify their role, modify their manager, or delete the record entirely.
